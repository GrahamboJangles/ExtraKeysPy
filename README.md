# ExtraKeysPy
Have a keyboard without media keys? Want to volume up/down with a keybinding? Want to change that keybinding to whatever you want? Want to add even more keybindings? Here ya go.

If you want to change the keybindings, scroll to the bottom of the python file and change the strings that look like "alt+up"
